This is an example how to list webshop items from a google sheet document using sheetdb api.
The sheet document should look like the sample.png image in the img folder.
if you want to add an image to a product the ID of the product has to be the name of the image (only webp image format works).
its important to get your own SheetDB api and link it to your google sheet. Replace the api link in the code.js file with your own.
This way, multiple user can access, edit, add or remove items without coding on the webpage.
